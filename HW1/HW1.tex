As a third year Computer Science student here a RIT, I have a very large array of careers to choose from in my future. My main interests in my field are in applied computing, data science, machine learning and computational science. I recently completed a two-semester long co-op with a Professor here at RIT funded by the FAA and MITRE. For this project, I used a graduate student's masters thesis from the University of North Dakota to create a new metric that general aviation pilots to use to identify potentially unsafe and dangerous conditions. These metrics evaluate the risk that their airplane will enter an aerodynamic stall and loose control. The goal here is to increase the safety of general aviation as it is not nearly as safe as commercial aviation in the United States. This means that my CTM at the present moment, in a general sense, would be using the power of compuatation to perform scientific research in order to improve the safety of general aviation. Going forward, I like the idea of doing research as my career. As such, I plan on attending a graduate PhD Program at another university after my time here at RIT. \\
